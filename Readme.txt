This is a basic  twitter sentiment analysis project you dont need high Nueral Network or python knowledge to run this code.
This project is for only 2 classes which are positve and negative setinments. You can train for more than 2 classes by changing the code slightly.
We used glove library for embedding our dataset for training becasue it becomes hectic when we do it ourselves and train as well when we are working on a small project.
To understand the working of RNN you can consult the following websites or blogs:
